try with one data file - initially save in raw data and then save as RData
like save(data1, file = "data.RData")

also have one script file as an example to work on that

? maybe avoid match as it is an inbuilt function - switch to games

  not tbl_df by default

  only some of files have lower case - need to revert to these

  goals/assists

  with kanes goals i have 106 v 105 (maybe just not updated correctly)

  Processs is in demo
  Then copy example function to the R folder (players) run Build load check function in
  console which sources all R scripts in R directory (will want to get rid of hello and move demo outside or buildignore maybe better for demo)
  tehn Build> check Package runs some base pacakge R CMD I beliecve (Hester talks too quickly)
  I got Rtools is required -- though I thiught it was
subsequently updated RStudio got different error refer to logs but cannot see them
installed new rstudio got diff error

Did Build/Install and Restart and seemed to work loaded in the packages list
and opens in other project so looks gooduse


code insert Roxygen skeleton - used engsoccerdata as example
then in Jim hester documents under build but msiiing it is
First time using roxygen2. Upgrading automatically...
Warning: The existing 'NAMESPACE' file was not generated by roxygen2, and will not be overwritten  #this is waht is in NAMESPACE exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")
Writing player_scoring_method.Rd (it is in man along with hello.RD which I will dlete\or add to builsd ignore along with the hello.R file)

when clickin on package in window bit weird - either show wrong thing or help
has the hello.R but not real function

usethis::use_test() creates a test-players file with boilerplate that can be changed
has an expect_equal() but bit tricky with dataframe being returned - easier with atomic vector



recommended packages tidyverse/DT/plotly/shiny
